find_all()
You can use find_all to extract all the occurrences of a particular tag from the page.
we can see find_all will give us all the items matching the search criteria we
define. All the filters we can use with find_all() can be used with find() and other searching
methods too like find_parents() or find_siblings().

We have seen above, find_all() is used to scan the entire document to find all the contents
but something, the requirement is to find only one result. If you know that the document
contains only one <body> tag, it is waste of time to search the entire document. One way
is to call find_all() with limit=1 every time or else we can use find() method to do the
same:
Syntax
find(name, attrs, recursive, string, **kwargs)
