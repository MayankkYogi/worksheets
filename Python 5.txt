Sets are a mutable collection of distinct (unique) immutable values that are unordered.
To intialize a set with values, you can pass in a list to set()

Lists are slightly faster than sets when you just want to iterate over the values.

Sets, however, are significantly faster than lists if you want to check if an item is contained within it. They can only contain unique items though.
